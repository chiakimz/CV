## Education
### Makers Academy (January 2018 to May 2018), London, UK
   Makers Academy is one of Europe's Leading Web Developer bootcamps. I learned all the technical skills listed below, but what I learned the most was personal development, emotional intelligence and most importantly, how amazing it is to work as a team. I feel like a grew as a person a lot more than anything else.
- Javascript, Jasmine
- Node.js, React
- Ruby On Rails
- HTML5, CSS 
- Jquery 
- SQL 
- Test Driven Development 
- Agile Methodology
- Extreme Programming 
- Object-oriented design 
- version control with Git
My final project will involve;
-Python
-Machine Learning
-Tensorflow

### Hokusei Gakuen University (April 2009 to March 2013), Sapporo, Japan
- BA Hons in English Literature. My thesis was about American History and Politics, their effect on today's religious fundamentalism, politics and geography.
- My minor was Religious Studies. I was fascinated by how human mind works and how it can shape society. I am still interested in this area but my interests have broadened to psychology, philosophy and neuroscience. I am so in love with human arts and its integral point with science, especially how human brain's cognition can be used to understand computer science. 

## Experience
  As worked as a Chef/Pastry Chef for 4 years, I learned efficient communication, creativity, intense time management, performance under pressure, teamwork, decision making, attention to detail and enjoyed endless learning which I believe are transferable to software craftsmanship. 
I’ve worked in many places, which requires good adaptation skills, and my experience includes:
### Quaglinos London, UK  (Demi Chef de Partie)
   Queen Elizabeth II once dined here. High volume, high end restaurant in Mayfair. 
### Paul UK  London, UK  (Pastry Chef)
   French bakery of nearly 130 years history. My workplace was in charge of all cake and pastry production to be dispatched to all 40 branches across the country. 
  
   I worked as an English-Japanese Translator/Interpreter at New Holland HFT Japan, which taught me how to interact with clients and understand their needs, and as an English Teacher/Tutor (Kids-Adults) at various companies and independently, which developed my interpersonal skills, communication, and organisation.

## Five things that are special about me
### 1. I make things happen.
  You know those moments where you think ‘it would be nice if there is xyz,’? Many people would stop there, but I always take action to make it possible. At Makers Academy, I found that people in previous cohorts who did Machine Learning for their final project started learning it on their first week of the final project. I saw a room for an improvement there, and started organising a study group from 4 weeks before the project starts for those who are keen. It’s fascinating and very rewarding to see people with similar interests can gather and study together and help each other to get the most out of our course especially when it’s something you organised by yourself.
### 2. I have got an empathetic leadership style.
  A lot of people can take leadership, but very few of them can be an empathetic leader. I’d like to think of myself as a facilitator who lets communication happen smoothly amongst the team, and helps each team member understand each other. I once saw a significant tension in a group caused by a gap in level of understanding; one was irritated for debugging and the other was frustrated for being left behind. I suggested having a conversation as a team to improve the situation, and the team became less tense. Empathetic leaders don’t necessarily focus on goals, but on people and their situations, and help people communicate and make harmony.
### 3. I am driven for learning and developing.
  I have studied programming by myself for a year before joining Makers Academy. I’m always keen to gain knowledge in a broad range of topics.  As I previously stated, I’m eager to learn AI and Machine Learning; I have been helping my friend making his YouTube channel for AI Safety. It’s been over a year since the channel was established, and we managed to gain >22k subscribers. Not only have I learnt social media management but also AI and its concerns.
### 4. I contribute by honest communication.
  I value honesty and authenticity, and being clear. One coach once thanked me after the class for my contribution saying that it was very valuable for me to point out that X is not the only approach to reach the solution but Y is also plausible. He said it was beneficial as he was previously very fixated on X. By throwing in Y as an option, I succeeded in adding a variety to solve one problem. It takes courage to raise your hand to say “I don’t think it’s necessarily true” in front of a coach and a bunch of classmates, but I believe it’s valuable to have someone honest and brave enough in an organisation to add diversity in opinions and to avoid rushing into one set solution.
### 5. I am serious about making the world better. 
  One of the biggest reasons I’ve decided to change career is my encounter with Effective Altruism. I’ve always taken world peace seriously but EA showed me there are lots of other smart people out there who genuinely work on it. I would like to earn more money to give part of my income to the most effective charities, and also ideally in the future, I would like to be a part of AI Safety movement to avoid existential risk. I’ve been in the community for a while but once I get a job I’d like to engage with that  a lot more starting with making a pledge of 10% donation.

    Nice fact: I’ve been told that my laugh cheers people up by many people in different occasions! :)
