## Chiaki Mizuta

I am an independent woman who don’t need no man. I came to the UK in 2016 all by myself because I fell in love with this place 8 years ago. I am a diligent and enthusiastic person who loves learning and challenging her own borders. I am a deep, logical thinker, and honesty and dedication are two of my best characteristics I can be proud of. One of my hobbies is to go to the bookshop and spend my entire afternoon reading logic quiz books. I have worked in the catering industry after my graduate degree, because I was sick and could not work full time. I had been unwell for years and working as a chef was difficult, but I never wanted give up on my life and this society. Now am trying to make a career change in order to make a better use of my strengths. I want to make the world a better place, I always have, and I encountered this idea called Effective Altruism and they recommend earning to give, so becoming a Developer is my contribution to the society as well. I get so physically and mentally excited every time I see data, charts, statistics and analytics, and I would like to be a Data Scientist one day, not because it is said to be the sexiest job in 2016. I am super excited about the future technology would bring, but am also concerned about the existential risk that Artificial Intelligence can bring, and I would like to prevent the end of the world. I am fluent in both Japanese and English, and my English is pretty great, I do not have a typical Japanese accent. 

Here are some serious bit:

**Quick learner** - I never fail to amaze people with how quickly I learn, memorise things and commit to excellence. I taught myself and became fluent in English in just over a year, in my previous job; I excelled in pastry mass-production in PAUL UK, making products that are delivered to circa 30 branches across England, starting from a zero background in French pastry. I am currently studying computer programming online and have made significant progress in less than a year, as remarked by a specialist software developer.
**Attention to detail** – My previous work experiences have perfected this skill. As an interpreter and translator, accuracy and attention to detail was the key to keep the integrity of the documents and speech. In programming and as a highly proficient food producer, I am always diligent and dedicated to near perfection. As a result of my hard work and trial and error, my manager at CO-OP Sapporo remarked, “no one else can make such a beautiful piece that makes everyone want to buy.” 
**Organisation** – Learning independently requires a great deal organisation to ensure that I dedicate enough time to studying whilst in a full time job. As a chef, I always ensured that all the products for sale were made to a high standard. I also oversaw stock control, discount management and maintained great customer service. Keeping a timed schedule and calendar has always helped me work efficiently. As well as being a Pastry Chef in Japan, I often acted as an interpreter for English speaking customers to improve sales by overseeing the situations and organizing my time and work accordingly, quickly making decisions on different circumstances.
**Leadership and Responsibility** – I have on countless occasions been left in charge of the kitchen, this involved, training new staff, opening and closing the kitchen, liaising and leading communications with other sections to ensure the smooth running of operations. I successfully managed the opening of a new branch of Donguri Bakery under pressure. I notably contributed to the sales by giving creative suggestions and ideas in store operation strategies and development of new products.
